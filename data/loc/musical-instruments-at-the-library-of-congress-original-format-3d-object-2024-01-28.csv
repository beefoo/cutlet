Among my childhood playthings were also an old boxwood clarinet with flat brass keys, ivory rings, and a violin, which had belonged to my grandfather Miller. These disappeared in boy-hood days.

Badger's regular work on body and head....No  clue whatever, as to the 'System.'"" By 'Badger's regular work on body,' Miller refers to the maker's normal foot joint design plus his usual key cup design applied to the middle joint despite its bizarre fingering scheme. This apparently experimental system is perhaps the most unique in the Miller collection. The foot joint is standard, low C#, C, standing open, but the body contains 13 keys, all standing closed requiring a reasonably awkward technique if to function as a fully vented system according to Boehm. To hold this instrument is awkward in that the tonehole placement leaves no practical place to rest the right thumb and the left thumb placement is nearly as difficult. It is possible that this instrument was to receive a crutch for the RH, possibly also for the left, and never completed.

However, the ornate ferrule which surrounds it is of ivory and appearing at first glance to be all one piece. This construction is quite clear in that the ferrule material immediately adjacent to the key is broken off and clearly reveals the layered construction. At the upper end of the head joint, immediately beneath the cap, it is morticed to take a decorative ferrule (now missing), which DCM reported to be of animal horn. However, similar to the layered ivory construction of the foot joint, this original ferrule may also have been of wider outer diameter ivory.

That is true of this instrument although it once may have had the opposite problem of its metal tubing being too loose within its boxwood cylinders. This head joint has 4 brass nails or tacks driven into the wood, 2 in the barrel and 2 in the upper section about 3.5 cm. above the embouchure. Both pair of tacks are situated one on each side, about 180 degrees apart, and none of the 4 pierces the metal tube, although the upper tube has one corresponding hole (now out of alignment in circumference) where the tack may have been forced through or, more likely, a pilot hole drilled through by mistake. See ""Preface"" regarding pins in head joint. The exterior of such a metal head joint lining is usually roughened by deep scratches or by pulling up little points with a tool such as a scriber or graver. It appears that the pins were to be driven in far enough to make contact with such roughened or scribed areas of the metal tube(s) to prevent one or both from shifting out of position, especially in the upper section where the metal lining out of alignment would likely distort the embouchure undercutting.   Instrument type: Flute in C   Medium: Boxwood, ivory ferrules, [cap and cork-setting mechanism] silver keys, brass-lined head.;  66.05 cm. (without cap)   Key Holes System: 7 keys, to low C, pewter plug pads, pin in block. All but low C#, C, keys have been replaced with nickel silver keys with square flat flaps. Although from the Potter workshop, this instrument appears to be a composite of 2 or possibly 3 different instruments.

Key Holes System: Old system, conical bore, of the type known as Card's system. According to an indication in the DCM ledger, the head joint had a rectangular engraved silver plaque, now missing, which read: CARD'S / Improved (cursive) / PATENT. If so, this instrument incorporated Card's use of the Boehm system in the right hand but having only finger rings for right hand fingers 1, 2. However, this instrument has an added or possibly replaced (due to what seems to be the original key post location) finger 3 ring for the more typical Boehm F# fingering. The Card system also includes an alternate upper C key for the left thumb, now missing. Other alterations to this instrument, according to the DCM ledger, include: ""Keys evidently have been modified, by experiment. Now is closed G#, probably once had Dorus G#. Once had a D key (or special C#); hole now filled with wood. Foot keys in Boehm style of 1832.""   Mark Maximum: See Keys, etc., above.   Condition: Head joint, both sections, cracked. According to DCM, obtained with engraved silver plate, inlaid with mark, which is now missing. Present closed G# is a replacement with a key cup rather smaller than the original. Post holes have been plugged and fingerhole 3 has a bushing from the removal of the former, possibly open, G# alteration. A post hole has been plugged near fingerhole 4, purpose unknown. Lower ferrule on barrel is cracked. Foot joint socket cracked. The body lower tenon shoulder seems to have been slightly cut back with the missing wood material replaced by a horn ferrule.

It is in two sections (each being a double cone). When tightly closed, the tone of this one is good. It is the custom of the Indian to place the hand cup-wise over the end of this whistle and to move the hand so as to vary the tone, making it more like the call of a deer. This specimen is made of Sumac. Such a whistle is usually made more effective by pouring over it a decoction of some herb, 'medicine,' which is supposed to attract deer. These whistles were mad in various sizes."" As is, in the Miller collection, it is not clear which of the 2 similar components should be inserted into the other, the metal reed therefore being in the center or at the lower end. If at the lower end, the instrument can than take an extra wooden mouthpiece, now with it, but not received or noted by DCM. At the time of its acquisition, Miller recorded in his ledger that it was of Sumac wood, in two pieces, with a beating reed of sheet metal, inserted in lower open end, held in wooden wedges and ""caulked"" with cloth.

Old System of fingering, but keys very cleverly constructed in almost perfect imitation of Boehm System."" Miller bought the instrument in 1923 from Prof. Glanco Meriggioli of Milan. An April 22, 1922 letter to Miller from Meriggioli lists a number of instruments available for sale including what may be DCM 312, i.e., ""A piccolo in ebony, Albert system tube and wholes [sic], but Boehm System keys, with case."" If this instrument became DCM 312, it arrived without the case. More accurately described, this may be considered an 8-keyed or 14-keyed piccolo, six of the fourteen being key plates covering the 6 principal rank fingerholes. Most of the keywork is mounted on ribs in two extended paralled rod systems looking not unlike a Boehm or other modern system piccolo mechanism. The 8 keys include the normal 6-keyed system with 2 upper trill keys for the 1st finger RH. Miller further remarks: ""Casoli runs a 'Music Store', is not a real maker, made by Rampone & Reni, May 1923."" However, Langwill lists flutist (Alfredo) Casoli as an active maker, ca. 1906-1926, formerly in partnership with Barlassina.

See Notes","3d object","image","physical objects","","Physical Objects.   nonprojected graphic |   1 sound disc : analog ; 12 in.  |   Tenor recorder in Baroque or pseudo-Baroque style, date of instrument is not known. Portions of it (2 of the ivory ferrules) appearing quite old, with other aspects of the instrument leading one to believe it may be a replica. The one key on the foot joint has a double touch piece for right or left hand usage, although not well-fitted. Furthermore, on the open-standing key on the foot joint, the upper fulcrum key block is unnecessarily deep-cut so as to create a lateral opening (and consequently a leak) into the foot joint socket. As is, this instrument seems to be in B-flat at modern pitch, and therefore could be a tenor in that key as such. However, it could also be in A at high pitch, or in C at very low baroque pitch.   Instrument type: Tenor Recorder in (B-flat?)  See Notes.   Medium: Boxwood, stained brown, brass key, ivory ferrules.;  71 cm.

Riley, who was known as a musical instruments dealer. All 4 joints of this instrument have at least one knot. In addition to actual damage and repairs (see Condition) this flute has been curiously altered. The head joint above the embouchure o.d. (outer dimension) has been reduced about 1.6 mm. for a length of about 38.5 mm., perhaps for the installation of a metal ferrule, purpose unknown. There is no crack in that area requiring such a device. The head joint and both body joints each are decorated with 2 carved diamond patterns, the foot joint has one such decorative carving, and the entire lower end of the foot joint, approximately 2.5 cm. in length, is decorated in a similar small diamond pattern resembling that which would be left by a knurling tool. The square flat flap key presently on the instrument is likely a 2nd replacement key, and probably close to the size and design of the original key. At some point it (the original) was replaced with a larger (longer) key requiring the tonehole seat to be enlarged, and a second pin hole drilled about 5.5 mm. from the original. The key now present is somewhat too short at both ends but does make use of the original key pin hole. Head cap is likely a replacement and has been decorated with 8 radial grooves intersecting in the center.   Instrument type: Flute in C   Medium: Boxwood(?), brass key, pewter ferrules.;  61.45 cm.

This is a 4-joint 1-keyed flute, date unknown, likely turn of the 19th century. Each joint consists of 2 sections which have very short tenons with machine threads that screw together. The 6 fingerholes are bushed with recessed square silver inlays. Furthermore, the instrument is unique in that the unusually long lower body joint wide fingerhole spacing would imply that this instrument is in at least the key of C, or lower, or at a very low pitch. However, the head joint is curiously short (perhaps shortened?) and together with the instrument assembled would visually appear to be in a key centered around D. The present tonehole spacing as it relates in distance from the embouchure is such that musically this instrument is unworkable.   Instrument type: Flute in ?   Medium: Ivory, silver key and tonehole bushings.;  55.7 cm. (without cap)   Key Holes System: 1 key, square flat flap, pin in block.   Mark Maximum: No mark.   Condition: Head joint cap missing. No cracks but all of the threaded tenon connections are loose due to shrinkage. (See DCM 945 regarding threaded joint construction).   Provenance: Maude P.

The head joint is unique in that the socket is a separate threaded part, the tenon for it being on the main body part. The head joint cap, if original, is also unique in that judging from the embouchure hole placed so near the end (3.8 cm. from approximately the center of the hole) there is room only for a cork without threaded tuning mechanism. However, the cap has been drilled through its center to receive what may have been a decorative shaft common to such tuning mechanisms. Within that hole, there is what would appear to be the dome-shaped end of such a shaft, now serving only as a decorative item.

All 3 joints are shorter than comparable instrument in C. This instrument is further unusual in that the top joint has a thumbhole (perhaps later added). Also unusual in that the upper end above the baluster decoration has an ivory ferrule over a tenon, possibly not original, the interior element of which takes a separate ivory insert in the form of a pirouette, but probably not meant to function as such. This may be original, or added as a type of tuning slide.   Instrument type: Oboe in ?   Medium: Ivory, silver keys, 2 black horn ferrules.;  50.4 cm.   Key Holes System: 3 keys, square flaps, pin in block. Originally with left E-flat key missing and hole plugged.   Mark Maximum: ROVGE   Mark Additional: Mark on each joint.   Condition: The top of the bore is cracked, and the unusual construction may have been an attempt to correct this or perhaps the length of ivory available was insufficient for the design. Upper joint, cracks at upper end under ivory ferrule, mentioned above. Lower joint, several cracks in socket, ivory only. Horn ferrule unaffected, maybe not original. C key hole improperly drilled at location under left E-flat key position, including key. Original keys restored by DCM. Crack in bell from one of two vent holes to bottom or rim. Slot cut in lower key mount ring. That hole was plugged with ivory at unknown time.   Provenance: Sumner Healey, New York, 7 June 1924.   Nonprojected Graphic (Form).

Elkin copied this description in his letter to DCM, 15 July 1924: ""Dear Mr. Elkin, After a good deal of trouble I have managed to secure a Maori KOAUAU or native flute. Though I have lived in N Zealand for over 35 years this is the first one I have seen. I have often heard about the Maori flute but had not [seen] one before. They are only in use away in the back blocks. I am told that the instrument is usually blown with the nose, but is also blown with the mouth. I feel sure you will never get any music out of it, but the Maori who brought it to me could play a little - enough to hear the tone - which is soft, full, and very pleasing. The Maori tunes are very simple & sound more like a dirge than anything else. Although there are only 3 holes they appear to manufacture a few more notes with the mouth. To play - you blow with the small end - put one edge of the hole to the side of your mouth. The angle is something like holding a flute & as you blow softly the wind strikes the other edge of the hole. The angle is determined so that the edge of the hole in the flute seems to split the wind in two & makes the sound. (Note here by C[orkill] 'It seems that our grandfathers or g. g. grandfathers were not the ones to introduce the modern transverse flute; the Maoris held this above described flute like our modern flute.') The flute sent you has a history. It belonged to an old Maori Chief in the URIWERA country North Island New Zealand near Lake Waikaremoana. The chief is now dead. His name was AURAE or in English 'July.' This flute was found among his belongings & was destined to be burnt. It is the custom to burn all the knicknacks and clothes belonging to the dead and even money if it is in their pockets. I hope this will reach you safely & may it suit your purpose for the Museum.""   Instrument type: Kooauau (End-blown Flute)   Medium: Unidentified wood, brown.;  16.1 cm.

Wood."" Ivory, highly elaborately carved with oriental and floral design. The head joint tuning slide mechanism is unusual structurally speaking. Most of the upper section is not metal lined. The tuning slide male tube (silver) contains a brass threaded ferrule, which is held in place by corresponding threads in the ivory tube. The lower section or barrel of the head joint then contains threads cut into its upper end, which in turn takes a brass ferrule containing corresponding threads which then becomes the outer tube of the tuning slide assembly.   Instrument type: Flute in C   Medium: Ivory, silver cap, keys, and ferrules.;  66.85 cm.   Key Holes System: 8 keys, foot to C, typical 19c English style. Keys engraved all over, of unusual design. Described by DCM as follows: ""flat flaps, hinged at one edge, closing down like a trap-door, raised by a lever engaging in a loop on the upper side."" Six of the keys are mounted standard pin in block style. Two (long F and upper C) are mounted in bassoon-like metal saddles, which DCM felt may have been later additions. However, they could also be original for purposes of covering no more carved area than necessary. The metal key mounts are affixed not with a standard downward screw design, but apparently have a sort of integral silver keel-like element morticed into the ivory and held in place with a metal pin, looking very much like the crack-preventing pins commonly found on English clarinets of the period.   Mark Maximum: No mark.   Condition: Head joint, upper section, 2 small cracks.   Provenance: John T. Shiel, Walkden, near Manchester, England, 1 Jan. 1925.   Nonprojected Graphic (Form).

DCM ledger quotes letter from Thurlow Lieurance, who gave the flute to Miller: ""This was made by Red Fox, a Qupaw Indian at Miami Oklahoma.

This instrument is obviously the work of an amateur builder in an attempt to produce a flute approximately an octave above the standard C (D-flat?) piccolo. The upper end has been turned on a lathe to form a head joint of approximately 7.2 cm in length, which appears to be growing from that end of the instrument! Similarly, the bottom end has also been turned to provide a decorative simulated foot joint. The actual functioning bore is installed in only the upper half. The toneholes, if actually in approximately accurate positions, are too close together to actually be covered. It is curious that as clever as this design may be for an amateur, he left no way to adjust the head joint cork further away from the embouchure, only closer to it.   Instrument type: Piccolo in unidentified key (See Notes.)   Medium: Unidentified hard wood, bone head joint cap and bottom ferrule, brass key guard plates, brass keys.;  Rectangular shape approximately 32-34 mm. by 14-15 mm. See Notes. Sounding length is 13.2 cm.   Key Holes System: 6 keys, square flat flaps, operated by long brass levers which extend downward, along the underside. Each incorporates a 90 degree bend extending upward through perforations in the wood and each terminates in a brass concave finger button riveted to the key end. In effect, this is a 1-keyed piccolo. In addition to the amateur but cleverly done keywork and lever system, there are 3 brass guard plates, the largest of which is a right thumb rest, each applied with brass pins.   Mark Maximum: C F (flat sign) ?   Mark Additional: Mark on back.   Provenance: Auguste Buffet (daughter of Djalma Julliot), Paris, 26 July 1926.   Nonprojected Graphic (Form).

The 2 body joints are unique in that each fingerhole grouping positions the holes at an angle favoring the hand involved. DCM 801 is constructed slightly that way. The head joint bears a Schlegel stamp but not the alignment number 2 as on the upper joints, and probably is not original to this flute. The various Schlegel marks indicate the flute may be a composite from the workshops of Christian and his son Jeremias. Furthermore, this head joint, in addition to a poorly altered embouchure hole, also has drilled further down the tube, 4 large holes, measuring approximately 9.5 millimeters in diameter, their purpose unknown. It is possible that this head joint was declared unuseable in the shop, and may have been assigned to an apprentice wishing to practice with the drilling equipment of the time (probably a bow drill).

The initial large socket crack has been repaired with 4 large threaded cross pins followed by what would appear to be possibly later repairs of the same problem in the form of a brass wire winding between pins 2 and 3. This repair treatment was followed by a contemporary or possibly even later repair attempt utilizing a sheet brass ferrule (3.1 centimenters in length) which may also have been introduced to counteract wood loss at the socket now involving approximately 130 degrees of material cracked away and missing. Beneath the brass ferrule is a cracked ivory ferrule which may be original to this instrument, at least according to DCM. Foot joint socket crack extended to E-flat tonehole. The E-flat key block channel and pad seat appear to have been crudely enlarged and out of alignment.

All fingerholes are bushed with silver. The 2 RH little finger keys (D#, low C, depending on lay of instrument) have elegantly executed rollers as well as 2 of the LF little finger keys (long F and low C#). The labium edge is veneered with silver attached with silver rivet. The instrument has a period case which supports the original existence of a small clarinet-shaped bell and a small hat-shaped embouchure cap which were surely of the same material as the body joint. However, those elements now with the instrument are somewhat crudely made of (possibly) stained walnut or mahogany and slightly undersized regarding their compartments in the case. The ferrules on the apparently replacement bell and embouchure cap may have been retained from those original items. DCM ledger: ""[I:ZIEGLER / WIEN].""

The RH little finger also operated a key which in turn moves a thin metal rod vertically through the entire lower bore and caps off the block for the lower fipple to create a single flageolet, or, if played as a double, that key is not used and the lower pipe utilizes one right thumbhole, 2 RH thumb keys (G, A), and 2 LH little finger keys (F, B).

Carved with floral design, fruit, leaves, and birds. This recorder is unusual in that the head joint is made of 2 sections, which are joined with machine threads and likewise the foot joint is comprised of 3 sections, the middle and lower 2 of which are also joined with machine threads. However, the foot joint upper section, which contains the little finger tonehole, may have originally contained the female threads joining it to the middle portion in the same way. However, if so, the threading may have been damaged and altered to its present state which is a tenon and socket (tenon on middle section) which is lapped with thread or twine.

The edge is chipped and damaged, but still somewhat playable. However, the head joint upper section was clearly split into 2 large portions which were rejoined temporarily by Robert Sheldon using the acrylic adhesive B72 (for exhibition purposes). Ivory chips missing at beak. This instrument was included in the Music Division exhibition, ""In Praise of Music,"" in 1992 and was treated cosmetically at that time. The middle portion of the foot joint was curiously missing a slab of ivory not broken away but intentionally removed, creating a flat surface as the result of a saw cut, purpose unknown. A portion of ivory was added by Robert Sheldon using an alophatic adhesive and left slightly oversize to be further finished or worked as desired, or removed.

It is also possible that the G# key was an addition in that there is very little wood mass in the baluster to support such a key block. Furthermore, the G# hole placement is rather clumsy in that it is very close to the decorative bead at the bottom of the baluster and very coarsely executed. The area of the missing F key has been damaged and crudely morticed to receive what may have been a metal flange supporting a key mount of unknown design applied with 2 steel pins or screws, one of which is still present.

The principal element forms about 290 degrees of a metal tubing section, the resulting gap of which is adequately larger than the average flute embouchure and therefore positioned in that manner. The tubing section is mildly flexible to serve as its own clamp for maintaining a desired position on the head. Riveted to it is a second such section of partial metal tubing (about 160-170 degrees) to which is riveted (or pinned) an ivory or bone mouthpiece. Its duct is curved in a manner to deliver an airstream in the form of an arc (about 90 degrees). Between the two metal tube elements is a pair of small flat springs allowing the player to alter slightly the distance of the mouthpiece to isolate partials as necessary or for dynamic control. The inside of the device is partially lined with a cushioning material, the originality of which is unclear. See DCM 822 (regarding Patent), and DCM 1043b, 1340 (regarding mouthpiece).

Upper, lower, foot: GOULDING & Cº   Condition: Head joint and ferrule cracked at socket bearing a period repair including a well-designed tapered silver ferrule which is driven down over the socket. Additionally, a rectangular silver patch has been affixed to the ivory ferrule with 4 brass pins perforating both the ferrule and boxwood underneath to address the crack in each. Lower body joint socket has 3 cracks, including 2 in the ivory ferrule. A very curious repair attempt was introduced, the reason for which is difficult to understand: 4 brass pins perforate both the ferrule and the wood underneath, 2 on each side of one of the 2 ferrule cracks. Originally this repair perhaps addressed a single crack in the ferrule and was thus only meant to secure the ferrule to the instrument. However, continued shrinkage brought about an even wider second crack in the ferrule, and 2 of the pins have generated one of the 3 cracks in the socket itself. Foot joint bottom ferrule cracked (ivory).   Provenance: Charles E. Derry, Omaha, Nebraska, 20 Apr. 1931.   Nonprojected Graphic (Form).

Burghley (Burleigh) / Flute in C","3d object","image","physical objects","1845","Physical Objects.   nonprojected graphic |   1 sound disc : analog ; 12 in.  |   DCM ledger: ""...right-hand Crutch [missing]. No slide. Special cork screw for fixed position. Cork faced with wood. Holes of nearly uniform large size, and nearly equal spacing.... This 'Chromatic System' uses all ten fingers and thumbs, lifted successively. The left thumb does double duty, opening perforation [?] key and then opening key. This gives (with bottom open end and its octave) all the tones of the chromatic scale (two keys only needed!). A special support, or crutch, for right hand is used (this crutch is lost, not being complete on any of the seven specimens). Some of the flutes have lower foot-keys for C# and C, operated by right little finger as on ordinary flute."" The endcap includes a novel threaded variation of the adjustable cork-setting mechanism. The cork itself is faced with a wooden disk. Similar to the Giorgi and other such chromatic, nearly keyless, flutes having large and well-vented toneholes, this system, despite whatever are its merits, can only be dauntingly inconvenient for the perfomer in all keys. Technical proficiency therefore has been sacrificed in favor of reduced mechanical complexity and conveniences. The tonehole seats for the keys are separate turnings of either wood or bone(?) glued into position. Each key on any of the Burghley flutes is applied at its far end with a threaded wooden, ivory or bone screw (fulcrum), squarehead for wrench or socket. A second threaded wooden machine screw (ball-shaped head) positioned near its respective tonehole secures the key and acts as a guide rod and vertical adjustment device. Each key on Burghley flutes is designed and applied in a way that it becomes its own spring. This basic straight model (DCM 1092) was perhaps the prototype which is awkward to hold given the fingering problems posed by the left little finger and right hand thumb toneholes. The next two C treble flutes (DCM 1093, 1094) seem to be attempts to render at least the treble or C flute-size more comfortable. Each size and model of the Burghley flute is equipped with a right hand crutch made entirely of wood components which fills the glove space between the thumb and the right hand 1st finger and the instrument, similar to the crutch currently used on the German bassoon. Even with the crutch, these instruments are quite awkward to hold. In addition to these seven Burghley flutes (DCM 1091 through 1097) Miller completed the set with a bass (DCM 1238), likely in C.   Instrument type: Flute in C   Medium: Mahogany, japanned wood keys, ivory ferrules. Cork is wood-faced. See DCM 1091. The Burghley flutes contain no metal elements at all.;  57.65 cm.   Key Holes System: 1/7 holes plus 2 keys. Wood keys applied with wooden pegs in a way to utilize the key itself as its own spring.   Mark Maximum: No mark.   Condition: Crutch missing entirely. Low D key broken between guide pins but improperly repaired so that it is now sprung in the closed position whereas it should stand open. One must comment regarding all of the Burghley flutes that their design and materials are absurdly quite fragile, especially for the alto and bass models. They appear for good reason(s) to have had little or no use, which may explain their relatively good condition regarding a surprisingly low number of cracks.

The main body joint has a crutch for the right hand. The foot has 3 long keys pinned to the end of an extended or flared bell section which is acoustically of marginal function due to a pair of vent holes positioned about 6.8 centimeters from the lowest (written C) tonehole. The keys are positioned one above the other for their entire length, terminating in carved wooden touch pieces, the C#, C keys are notched in a way to allow stacking of the keys so that closing the longer, for C#, also closes the D hole, and the C touch piece will close all 3 toneholes. At their lower end, the keys are attached with a wooden threaded pin so that each forms its own spring. Each tonehole cover hangs from a wooden threaded shaft thereby making it adjustable in height. Another wooden threaded pin perforates all 3 keys at their upper end (between the D#, D holes) serving as an alignment and adjustment post. The D key lever at the bottom of its touchpiece is perforated and threaded to receive a perpendicular threaded bone pin. It is in turn similarly threaded to receive another perpendicular threaded bone pin. Purpose unknown. It appears to be an adjustment mechanism although the threading allows far too much play to maintain any given fixed position. See DCM 1092. See ""Flute Misnomers"" regarding Bass vs. Alto.

Keys lettered and numbered. Instrument consists of a standard English Patent double flageolet to which is attached a 3rd or bass pipe connected at the top between the 2 fipple stocks via a boxwood tube, and at the bottom, by tying the 3 tubes together with gut or other cord. The wood grain of the added portions is less tight than that of the double flageolet and the markings are different altogether from the same workshop. The connecting support shaft between the bass and melody pipes (often of ivory, see DCM 721) is crudely made of cocus or similar wood. The knee support shaft containing the 2 tying holes is (compared to DCM 721) somewhat crudely made and the 2 melody pipes do not have cord-tying holes as on DCM 721. The right pipe terminates with a 7 centimeter keyless foot joint which appears to be musically necessary at all times, to be removed possibly when inserting into case.   Instrument type: English Triple Flageolet (Composite)   Medium: Boxwood, ivory mouthpiece, fingerstuds, and ferrules, nickel silver keys.;  56.7 cm. (without mouthpiece).   Key Holes System: Left: 0/7 holes with hole 1 plugged for half-hole vent and hole 7 closed by open-standing key now missing, plus 4 keys and a 5th key for high C on fipple stock. Right: 0/4 holes with 5 keys. Both fipples have cut-off key. Square flap, pin in block. The bass pipe has 4 pitch-giving thumb keys, an elevated (block) tonehole for the left little finger, originally having an elevated bushing of unknown material, and a windway cut-off key.

Condition: In addition to both sections of the head joint having the expected cracks (now filled), the exact original state of this instrument is hard to determine. The inlaid square silver lip plate obviously pertains to the presentation from Prowse. However, the decorative silver and gold ferrules are over original ivory ferrules and may also have been added for presentation purposes. The inlaid ivory embouchure bushing may also pertain in the same way, or, may pertain to a repair attempt, as the upper head crack passes nearly dead center through the embouchure hole. Furthermore, from the left of the presentation plate to the upper ferrule there is an entirely new section of the head joint, purpose unknown, most likely repair work to replace that element which may have been damaged beyond repair. In addition to the upper joint concave portion for LH 1st finger upper phalynx comfort, which appears to be original, a similar adaptation for the RH thumb is questionable.

Instrument type: Piccolo in C   Medium: Cocus, silver keys and ferrules, metal-lined head.;  31.5 cm.   Key Holes System: Simple system as follows: this is essentially a 6-keyed instrument with a revised principal rank key and finger ring arrangement situated on 3 post and rod groupings, 2 of which are for the LH. Finger 1 operates a C# hole position quite high on the tube with a ring key that closes a vent key below finger 2 at the approximate position of the tonehole. In between principal rank toneholes 1 and 2 there was a tonehole at approximately the C hole location. It has been plugged either due to an error in drilling or it may have been closed by another vent key, the rod showing a solder stain where it may be been attached. Finger 2 operates a key for the B-natural hole which is placed high on the tube. Finger 3 operates the usual tonehole (for G) which has a ring key closing the same vent hole mentioned above. Fingerhole 4 operates a key plate for F# which then sounds from the next 3 rather than 2 principal rank toneholes standing open, thereby bringing up the pitch of the traditionally flat first finger F#. Finger 5 then closes with a key plate the next 2 toneholes plus a finger ring around tonehole 6 which makes possible a forked F.

First, from the markings it would seem to be a combination of two instruments. The actual make-up and craftsmen in the two shops is not well known. Although the wood appears to be boxwood uniformly stained brown, the head joint seems to be from a different wood supply than that of the body and foot joints. The head and foot joint socket and ferrule construction is most unusual. It is a well-executed, but poor design and likely an alteration. The original appears to have included the normal practice of turning (cutting away) material (boxwood) back to a shoulder to receive a fairly long ornate ferrule (ivory) glued in place. However, both have been turned a second time removing (in length) nearly a third of the ivory ferrule and replacing it with a fragile wooden ferrule (see Condition) as a spacer which is then covered with a well-made, turned silver ferrule. The silver ferrules are pronged on the interior for better retention similar to more modern woodwind instrument ferrules. The addition of the silver ferrules is not without good logic, but cutting away seemingly stable material (ivory) to apply them is a mystery. Neither socket is cracked and the apparent ferrule revisions seem not to have concerned any necessary repairs. The foot joint socket does have a knot which appears not to have needed an altered ferrule design. Perhaps the most unusual aspect is the foot joint exterior design. In place of the typical flared, false bell bottom, the foot tapers down similar to the traverso foot joint design(s) of the period, and the bottom ivory ferrule appears to be original, or period, or at least very skillfully applied if later.

Affixed to it and formed from a pine dowel is a tapered wooden wedge or baffle wall which has the effect of altering the cylindrical bore to one incorporating the tapered or parabolic nature of the standard modern flute head joint. This is an experimental device opposite the embouchure hole and can be rotated approximately 40 degrees for the purpose of altering the instrument's playing characteristics. The amount of rotation is stopped by a lateral metal pin moving in a groove cut in the end of the head joint tubing. See DCM 1494 Notes.
