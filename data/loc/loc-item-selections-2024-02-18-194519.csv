false,,1410,"An early parent to the modern almanac, these ""monthly rules"" are often found in astrologically focused medical manuscripts.  In the Rosenwald copy, the twelve months of the year, titled in red ink for easy locating, border the central figure affectionally known to medievalists as ""Vein Man.""  Instructions pertaining to each vein surround the body in a system of circles that connect to the pertinent point of the body via conspicuous red lines. In the Middle Ages, medicine was very much intertwined with astrology and other nonscientific superstitions. This manuscript on vellum, produced in southern Germany around 1410, contains pen and ink drawings with explanatory texts in German and Latin. The first drawing shows the earth and seven planets. It is followed by Zodiac-man, a naked man shown with the 12 signs of the zodiac, each relating to a specific part of the body. Next are four bloodletting charts of the human body. Such bleeding charts or calendars were widely used in this period. They provided instructions on the optimum days on which to draw blood, and the body points from which to draw it. The very complexity of the instructions offered-they varied for different phases of the moon, different diseases, and different body points- lent a degree of credibility to an essentially worthless and often harmful act. The work concludes with drawings of the Tower of Wisdom (text in German); a man called Microcosmus; a man called Macrocosmus; the Tree of Virtue; Philosophy surrounded by the Seven Arts; stories showing the evil power of women; the Tree of Babylon (or vice); the Tower of Wisdom (text in Latin, on two leaves); and the Wheel of Fortune.

false,,1465-01-01,"Also available in digital form. Bequest Mary L. McClure December 20, 1944. 明成化間刻本。四卷. Ming woodblock print, ca. 1465-1487. 十四行二十三字. Fourteen lines with twenty-three characters per line. Miss Mary McClure, of Fenchow, Shansi, China, has placed on deposit a Ming edition of the Buddhist work, Shi shi yuan liu ying hua shi ji (The origin of Buddhism and its development in China), originally issued under the auspices of the Emperor Chenghua (成化) in 1486. This work, in 4 juan, and 4 volumes (each page 23 by 41 cm), is ascribed in the imperial preface to a priest, Baocheng, who probably lived in the early Ming since the narrative itself is carried through the close of Yuan. According to Baocheng, there were six chapters in the original version of this work, with the title Shi jia ru lai ying hua lu. Volume I depicts the life of Gautama Buddha through the period of enlightenment; volume II his ministry; volume III the spread of Buddhism to China; and volume IV the reception accorded to this religion by Chinese emperors and officials of various dynasties. Each volume contains 100 paintings colored by hand, each painting accompanied by a page of quotation from other works dealing with the episode in question. These paintings, including the 200 which have their setting in India, are almost wholly Chinese in background, architecture, costumes, utensils, etc. According to a note at the close of volume I this copy was formerly deposited in the now ruined monastery of Tian ning si in the east suburb of Fenzhou, in Shanxi Sheng, where Miss McClure obtained it. During the years 1787-93 the drawings in the first two volumes were redone in black and white under the auspices of a Manchu prince of the blood, Yongshan, who died in 1797. These represent a considerable departure from the original, and the accompanying text is curtailed. This abridged edition was printed in 1808 by Prince Youfeng under the title Chong hui Shi jia ru lai ying hua shi ji, indicating that the pictures were redrawn and that the work deals with the rise and spread of Buddhism in India. Included is an essay by Wang Bo with the title Shi jia ru lai cheng dao ying hua shi ji ji. 御製序云:「此朕於寶成釋氏源流一書，幾務暇，偶爾一觀，不得不嘉其用心之勤也。茲欲重新繡梓，以廣其傳。」劉若愚內板經書紀略有:釋氏源流應化事蹟四本，四百四十葉」，即此本是也。按寶成原書凡六卷，題為「釋迦如來應化錄」，由此可知此本付梓前，已有改編與合併。每一故事，插畫一幅，蓋先雕印輪廓，後鋪彩色，其顏色之鮮明，與歐洲中古時代之寫本書插畫極相似，故西人極寶愛之。卷端載王勃釋迦如來成道應化事蹟記一文，後人因此題王勃撰者，誤也。御製(序)成化二十二年.",2012402109-19.jpg,2012402109,https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:asian:lcnclscd:2012402109:1A000:00001a/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg#h=4659&w=4820,,image,book,lcnclscd;chinese rare book digital collection;asian;asian division;world digital library;catalog,9,http://www.loc.gov/resource/lcnclscd.2012402109.1A002/?sp=19,https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:asian:lcnclscd:2012402109:1A002:18b19a/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg,,https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:asian:lcnclscd:2012402109:1A000:00001a/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg,Shi shi yuan liu ying hua shi ji : si juan.,http://www.loc.gov/resource/lcnclscd.2012402109.1A002/?sp=19,https://www.loc.gov/item/2012402109/

Borisov was born into a family of serfs in Simbirsk (present-day Ulyanovsk) and was forced to work from an early age. In the late 1880s he moved to the city of Barnaul in Altayskiy Kray, where in 1894 he opened a photography studio. This studio later became the largest and most popular in the city.

He took around 1,500 photographs during this expedition, which, upon his return to Barnaul, he presented to the public through the use of a magic lantern. The photographs depict views of nature in remote corners of the Altay Mountains and the Altay and Kazakh peoples indigenous to this region. Borisov offered the photographs to various European publishers for the production of postcards. The collection includes two series of color postcards.

false,,1926-01-01,"Metropolis, by director Fritz Lang (1890--1976), is generally regarded as a masterpiece of German Expressionist filmmaking and a forerunner of modern science-fiction movies. The film was shot in 1925--26 at the Babelsberg (Berlin) studios of the leading German film company, Universum Film AG (Ufa), and premiered in Berlin in January 1927. This 1926 art-deco poster by German graphic artist and painter Heinz Schulz-Neudamm (1899--1969) was created for the premiere. Lang's film, based on the novel of the same name by his wife, Thea von Harbou (1888--1954), depicts an urban dystopia, set in the year 2000, in which a class of managers living in luxurious skyscrapers suppress an underclass of workers who live and work underground. Schulz-Neumann's poster features a female automaton that figures prominently in the film and plays a role in an elaborate plot to liberate the workers. In the background are seen the skyscrapers in the futuristic city of Metropolis. Only four copies of Schulz-Neudamm's poster are known to exist, one of which was sold in London in 2005 for a record price of 398,000, making it the most expensive poster in the world. This copy from the Austrian National Library is a vintage print without the film's credits. It is part of the collection ""Archive for the History of Film,"" established in 1929 at the national library by theater researcher and musicologist Joseph Gregor (1888--1960).",2021669965.jpg,2021669965,https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:04:31:6:wdl_04316:3_2_16301956/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg#h=2970&w=1315,germany,compressed data;image,"photo, print, drawing",austrian national library;world digital library - partner items;world digital library;catalog,1,,https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:04:31:6:wdl_04316:3_2_16301956/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg#h=2970&w=1315,motion pictures;film posters;skyscrapers;androids;lithographs;science fiction;germany;art deco;metropolis (motion picture : 1927),https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:04:31:6:wdl_04316:3_2_16301956/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg,Metropolis.,https://www.loc.gov/item/2021669965/,https://www.loc.gov/item/2021669965/
false,,1838-01-01,"This print is an exterior view of the abolitionist meeting place and adjacent buildings at Sixth and Haines Streets in Philadelphia. Several pedestrians stroll the sidewalks. A carriage and horse-drawn cart pass by on the street. The hall, erected in 1838 as an arena for ""free discussion,"" was set aflame by hostile mobs on May 17, 1838, after three days of dedication ceremonies and services involving both free blacks and white abolitionists. The ruins of the building continued to stand until the Odd Fellows Society built a hall on the lot in 1846. The illustration has been attributed to John Caspar Wild (circa 1804--46), a Swiss-born artist and lithographer who produced paintings and prints of Philadelphia and other American cities. It was probably printed by the firm of Wild & Chevalier.
